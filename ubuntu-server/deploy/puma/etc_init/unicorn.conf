# /etc/init/unicorn.conf - unicorn config

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple unicorn instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See workers.conf for how to manage all unicorn instances at once.
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/unicorn.conf then manage unicorn with:
#   sudo start unicorn app=PATH_TO_APP
#   sudo stop unicorn app=PATH_TO_APP
#   sudo status unicorn app=PATH_TO_APP
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service unicorn {start,stop,restart,status}
#
description "unicorn Background Worker"

# no "start on", we don't want to automatically start
stop on (stopping unicorn-manager or runlevel [06])

# change apps to match your deployment user if you want to use this as a less privileged user (recommended!)

setgid admin

#. /etc/environment
